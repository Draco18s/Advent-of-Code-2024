*Day 1: dumb error on part 1 cost me 60 seconds. Unknown error on part 2 cost me another bit (>60 seconds). I got an answer that was 0.3% off and I don't know how and can't reproduce it. Edit: Figured it out. I must have fat-fingered a ctrl-x when pressing ctrl-s on my input file and lost a line.*
*Day 2: started 11 minutes late because I DIDN'T SET AN ALARM.*
*Day 3: eeey sub-1000. Part 2 took two guesses. My first attempt was incorrectly determining the most recent do/don't instruction.*
