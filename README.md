*Day 1: dumb error on part 1 cost me 60 seconds. Unknown error on part 2 cost me another bit (>60 seconds). I got an answer that was 0.3% off and I don't know how and can't reproduce it. Edit: Figured it out. I must have fat-fingered a ctrl-x when pressing ctrl-s on my input file and lost a line.*
*Day 2: started 11 minutes late because I DIDN'T SET AN ALARM.*
*Day 3: eeey sub-1000. Part 2 took two guesses. My first attempt was incorrectly determining the most recent do/don't instruction.*
*Day 5: eeey sub-1000. Part 2 was "oh I can juse use a custom comparison sort operation."*
*Day 6: solved it using an inefficient solution and found the better one after it was done. The 9 minute execution time was longer than the amount of time than I expected it to take me to work out better.*
*Day 7: part 1 ran "fast enough," part 2 did not. While it was crunching I worked out the optimization.*
*Day 8: accidentally did part 2 for part 1 before seeing the "and double distance" extra note. And took longer on part 2 than should have, because I was too lenient in the difference of doubles...*
*Day 9: I kept getting the wrong answer over and over again. Took forever to locate that I was erroneously creating 0-sized free memory blocks that were messing with the checksum calculation.*
*Day 10: Started late because exact-start timer didn't chime. Oh well.*
*Day 11: Straight forward fishbuckets problem.*
*Day 12: Part 2: Had to get help from Reddit for this one.*
*Day 13: Part 2 I didn't spot the line-line intersection right away.*
*Day 14: A puzzle from a couple years ago gave me an idea how to approach part 2, turns out that part 1 actually helped solve part 2, but was not obvious.*
*Day 15: Part 2 had a complex failure state that was hard to locate.*
*Day 16: Part 2 decided to be stubborn, for no reason.*
*Day 17: Part 2 was absoltely bonkers hard and was basically reversing a one-way cryptograpic cypher algorithm. Yuck.*
